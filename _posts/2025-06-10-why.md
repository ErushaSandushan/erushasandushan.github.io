## 🚀 Why This Blog?

Hey! I'm **Erusha Sandushan** — a Computer Science undergrad, cybersecurity enthusiast, and system administrator. This blog isn't just a personal space; it's my **digital lab notebook**, my **learning log**, and my attempt at building a **credible public footprint** in the world of cybersecurity and technology.

## 🧠 The Vision

I created this blog to:

- ✍️ Document my learning journey in cybersecurity, system administration, and academic topics.
- 🔎 Share original vulnerability research, CVEs, or interesting technical findings as I grow.
- 📚 Break down complex topics I learn in uni into digestible posts — helping others while reinforcing my own knowledge.
- 🧰 Showcase the projects, writeups, and tools I work on.
- 🌐 Build a **personal brand** rooted in honesty, curiosity, and contribution.

---

## 🎯 My Goals with This Blog

- Publish technical writeups on systems I audit or pentest (ethically, of course).
- Share walkthroughs of interesting bugs or vulnerabilities I encounter.
- Be transparent about my growth — even the mistakes and failures.

## 🧵 What You'll See Here

Even though I don’t have public CVEs or major research (yet), I’m building up toward it. Expect to see:

- Blog-style posts on tools, bugs, or configurations I find interesting
- CTF or lab walkthroughs (like HackTheBox, TryHackMe)
- Scripts, shell tips, or sysadmin tricks I use
- Possibly reflections on tech.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm still learning — always will be — and I’d love to connect with like-minded people in tech. If you're into security, Linux, or just building cool stuff, feel free to reach out.
