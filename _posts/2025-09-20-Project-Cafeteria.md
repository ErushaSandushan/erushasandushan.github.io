## What is Project Cafeteria?  

*Project Cafeteria* is a C++ and SQLite-based cafeteria management system I started as a personal challenge. The goal was to strengthen my C++ skills and practice database integration. I officially began learning C++ in September 2025.

## Backstory  

Before starting my academic module, I went through the student handbook to see what was ahead. Thatâ€™s when I noticed **C++** in the syllabus.  

Honestly, I used to *hate* C++. Coming from a Python-heavy background, I always struggled with pointers â€” the main reason I disliked it. But deep down, I knew that if I set myself a challenge, I would push through and complete it no matter how tough it got.  

So, I decided to face my fear head-on. After watching tutorials and reading resources, I jumped straight into building a real project. Thatâ€™s how *Project Cafeteria* was born.  

*(Side note: I had some prior exposure to C from reverse engineering, which helped a little.)*

## Project Roadmap  

The project started as a simple **command-line application**, but I quickly decided to raise the bar and add a **web API in C++** to communicate with the database in parallel.  

**Initial steps include:**  
- Menu creation  
- Ordering system  
- Admin login  
  - Sales reports  
- User management  
- Web API  
  - Admin panel  
  - Ordering system & reports  
  - Menu  

**Tech stack:** C++, SQLite, Crow, HTML/CSS/JS

## Challenges  

Itâ€™s only been two days since I started, and the **command-line tool is already complete**. The remaining work is the **Web API**.  

The journey hasnâ€™t been easy. C++ error handling and navigating documentation have been frustrating at times. But thanks to my previous coding experience, Iâ€™ve managed to push through and make solid progress.

## Lessons Learned  

- Donâ€™t just follow tutorials step by step.  
- Your goals may differ from what the tutorial covers.  
- If you rely only on tutorials, youâ€™ll often need to start over when building your own projects.  

ðŸ‘‰ My advice: **Learn the fundamentals first.** Without a solid base, youâ€™ll get stuck. Then, jump into a project aligned with your goals. That way, youâ€™ll face the exact problems you need to solve â€” and grow much faster.
